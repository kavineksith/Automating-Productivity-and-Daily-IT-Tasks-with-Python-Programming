# Documentation for GeoLocation and GPS Service Application

## Overview

### Application Name: **GeoLocator**

**GeoLocator** is a Python-based application that provides geolocation services by fetching real-time GPS coordinates and converting them into human-readable addresses. It leverages external libraries such as `geopy` for address lookup and the `gps` library to interface with GPS hardware through the `gpsd` protocol. This application is designed to be modular, with well-defined error handling and easy integration into other systems.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time GPS Data Fetching**: Fetches real-time GPS coordinates using a GPS receiver connected to the system.
- **Address Conversion**: Converts GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a readable address using the `geopy` geocoding service.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Handles errors such as failure to obtain GPS data or address not found for coordinates.
- **Extensibility**: The modular design of the application allows for easy extension and customization to meet specific use cases.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- The `geopy` library for geolocation services.
- The `gps` library for interacting with GPS hardware.
- A connected GPS device, or the ability to simulate GPS data.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install geopy gps
```

## Architecture

### Key Components:

1. **GeoLocationService**: Responsible for converting GPS coordinates into human-readable addresses.
2. **GPSService**: Interfaces with the GPS hardware and fetches real-time GPS data.
3. **GeoApp**: The core application logic that integrates both services and manages user interaction.

The application follows a layered architecture, where each component has a single responsibility and is designed to handle errors gracefully.

## Custom Exceptions

The application defines several custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios:

### 1. **AddressNotFoundError**
**Description**: Raised when the address corresponding to a given set of GPS coordinates cannot be found.

#### Constructor:
```python
def __init__(self, message="Address not found for the given coordinates."):
```
- **`message`**: A custom message that provides more details about the error (default: `"Address not found for the given coordinates."`).

**Usage Example**:
```python
raise AddressNotFoundError("No address found for coordinates: Latitude 40.7128, Longitude -74.0060")
```

### 2. **GPSFixNotFoundError**
**Description**: Raised when the GPS device fails to obtain a valid GPS fix.

#### Constructor:
```python
def __init__(self, message="Unable to get GPS fix. Try again later."):
```
- **`message`**: A custom message indicating the problem (default: `"Unable to get GPS fix. Try again later."`).

**Usage Example**:
```python
raise GPSFixNotFoundError("Failed to acquire GPS fix after several attempts.")
```

### 3. **GPSDataFetchError**
**Description**: Raised when an error occurs while fetching GPS data from the GPS hardware.

#### Constructor:
```python
def __init__(self, message="Failed to fetch GPS data."):
```
- **`message`**: A custom error message detailing the issue (default: `"Failed to fetch GPS data."`).

**Usage Example**:
```python
raise GPSDataFetchError("GPS data collection timed out.")
```

## Class Definitions

### 1. **GeoLocationService**

The **GeoLocationService** class provides functionality for converting GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) into human-readable addresses.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self):
    """Initialize the GeoLocationService class with a geolocator."""
    self.geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="GeoLocatorApp")
```
- **`self.geolocator`**: Initializes the `Nominatim` geocoder from the `geopy` library. The user-agent string is set to `GeoLocatorApp` to comply with the API usage policies.

#### Method: `get_address_from_coordinates`
```python
def get_address_from_coordinates(self, lat, lon):
    """Get address from latitude and longitude."""
```
- **Arguments**:
  - `lat`: Latitude of the location.
  - `lon`: Longitude of the location.
- **Returns**: Prints the address if found. If no address is found, raises an `AddressNotFoundError`.
- **Raises**: `AddressNotFoundError` if no address is found for the coordinates.
  
**Usage Example**:
```python
geo_service = GeoLocationService()
geo_service.get_address_from_coordinates(40.7128, -74.0060)
```

### 2. **GPSService**

The **GPSService** class interacts with the GPS hardware and retrieves real-time GPS coordinates.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self):
    """Initialize the GPSService class with gpsd."""
    self.session = gps.gps(mode=gps.WATCH_ENABLE | gps.WATCH_NEWSTYLE)
```
- **`self.session`**: Establishes a session with `gpsd` in watch mode to continuously fetch GPS data.

#### Method: `get_gps_coordinates`
```python
def get_gps_coordinates(self):
    """Get real-time GPS coordinates using gpsd."""
```
- **Returns**: A tuple containing the latitude and longitude if a valid GPS fix is obtained. If no valid fix is found, the method retries until a fix is acquired.
- **Raises**: `GPSDataFetchError` if an error occurs during the GPS data collection.
  
**Usage Example**:
```python
gps_service = GPSService()
lat, lon = gps_service.get_gps_coordinates()
```

### 3. **GeoApp**

The **GeoApp** class is the main entry point for the application, responsible for integrating the **GeoLocationService** and **GPSService** and managing the execution flow.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self):
    """Initialize the application with GeoLocationService and GPSService."""
    self.geo_service = GeoLocationService()
    self.gps_service = GPSService()
```
- **`self.geo_service`**: Instance of the `GeoLocationService`.
- **`self.gps_service`**: Instance of the `GPSService`.

#### Method: `run`
```python
def run(self):
    """Run the main functionality of the application."""
```
- **Description**: This method initiates the process of fetching GPS coordinates, converting them to an address, and handling any errors that may arise during the process.
  
**Usage Example**:
```python
app = GeoApp()
app.run()
```

## Error Handling

The application is designed to handle errors gracefully, with appropriate exception handling mechanisms in place:

- **GPS Fix Error**: If a valid GPS fix cannot be obtained, the application raises a `GPSFixNotFoundError`.
- **GPS Data Fetching Error**: If there is a problem fetching GPS data, a `GPSDataFetchError` is raised.
- **Address Not Found**: If no address is found for the given coordinates, the application raises an `AddressNotFoundError`.

The exceptions provide custom error messages that are logged to the console, making debugging easier.

## Example Workflow

Here is an example of how the application works:

1. The script starts and attempts to fetch GPS coordinates by calling `gps_service.get_gps_coordinates()`.
2. If the GPS fix is successful, the coordinates are passed to `geo_service.get_address_from_coordinates()` to retrieve the corresponding address.
3. The address is printed to the console. If the address cannot be found, an error message is printed.
4. If any exceptions are raised during this process, the error message is displayed in the console, and the application continues to handle the next steps gracefully.

### Example Output:
```
Fetching GPS coordinates... Press Ctrl+C to stop.
Latitude: 40.7128, Longitude: -74.0060
Coordinates: Latitude: 40.7128, Longitude: -74.0060
Address: New York, NY, USA
```

If no GPS fix is obtained:
```
Error: Unable to get GPS fix. Try again later.
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command from the terminal:
```bash
python geolocator.py
```

### Example Output for Errors:
```
Error: Failed to fetch GPS data: GPS device not found.
```

## Conclusion

The **GeoLocator** application provides a powerful solution for converting real-time GPS data into meaningful address information. Its modular design, custom error handling, and ease of use make it an excellent tool for geolocation-based projects. You can easily extend and customize the functionality to meet your specific needs, whether it's for a GPS-based tracking system, location-based services, or other geospatial applications.
