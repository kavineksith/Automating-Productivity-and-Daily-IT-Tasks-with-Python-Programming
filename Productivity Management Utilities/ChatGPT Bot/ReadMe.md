# ChatGPTBot Documentation

## Overview

The `ChatGPTBot` Python script provides a conversational interface powered by OpenAI's latest `gpt-3.5-turbo` (or `gpt-4`) model. It enables users to interact with a role-aware chatbot in a console environment, with features for role-switching, conversation persistence, user role management, and graceful error handling. This script is ideal for prototyping conversational assistants or educational exploration of LLM capabilities.

## Features

- **üí¨ Role-Based Interaction**: Switch between predefined chatbot roles such as:
  - `Friendly Assistant`: Polite, helpful, everyday conversations.
  - `Technical Support`: Focused on troubleshooting and technical answers.
  - `Expert Advisor`: Offers professional and high-level advice.

- **üë• User Role Management**: Choose between `general` and `admin` user roles to tailor the chatbot experience.

- **üß† Persistent Chat History**: Saves your full conversation to `chat_history.json` and reloads it in the next session.

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Robust Error Handling**: Custom exceptions for invalid role selection, OpenAI API issues, and file I/O errors.
