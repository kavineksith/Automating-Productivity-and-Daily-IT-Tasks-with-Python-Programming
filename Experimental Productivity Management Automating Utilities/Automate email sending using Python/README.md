# Secure Email Sender Script Documentation

## Overview
This script, written in Python, facilitates secure email transmission by encrypting sensitive email configuration details and utilizing the SMTP protocol for sending emails. It includes functionality for sending basic emails, emails with attachments, and supports custom email templates.

## Features
- **Secure Configuration Handling**: The script securely manages email configuration details by encrypting them using Fernet encryption and a passphrase. Configuration details include SMTP server address, port, username, and password.
- **Email Sending**: Provides methods for sending both basic emails and emails with attachments using the configured SMTP server.
- **Advanced Email Templating**: Supports custom email templates with placeholders for sender, receiver, subject, and message, allowing for dynamic email content generation.

## Script Components

### 1. SecureEmailConfig Class
- Responsible for loading and decrypting the encrypted configuration file.
- Utilizes Fernet encryption to decrypt the configuration file using the provided passphrase.

### 2. EmailSender Class
- Handles the sending of emails using SMTP.
- Includes methods for sending basic emails and emails with attachments.
- Provides email address validation.

### 3. SecureEmailSender Class
- Combines SecureEmailConfig and EmailSender functionalities.
- Initializes the EmailSender with decrypted configuration details.

### 4. Utility Functions
- **key_encryption**: Generates and encrypts an encryption key to be used for securing sensitive data.
- **get_non_empty_input**: Ensures user input is not empty, prompting for re-entry if necessary.

### 5. Main Functionality
- **main**: Orchestrates the email sending process by obtaining user input for email details and invoking SecureEmailSender methods.

## Usage
1. **Configuration Setup**: Ensure the existence of the configuration file containing SMTP server details, and an encrypted encryption key file.
2. **Customization**: Optionally provide custom email templates and attachments.
3. **Execution**: Run the script and follow the prompts to input email details.
4. **Security Considerations**: Maintain the confidentiality of the passphrase and encrypted key file.
